**Hi there 👋**

I'm Mark (he/him). I work as a customer-facing software engineer and tinker with tech in my free time. I'm a big fan of OSS, TypeScript, Docker, home automation and self hosting. I tend to aggressively (over)-use containerisation and orchestration everywhere - if it's not in Compose, Ansible or Git, it's not real.

### Things I Publish / Maintain
